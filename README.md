# Quines

A quine is a program that prints its own code, without accessing its source code file.
It is possible to write quines in any Turing-complete language.

## Here is a list of quine-like programs:

_minimal_ is the smallest quine that I could write so far

_base_ is a template to make programs that use their own code as an input

_stats_ analyses its code, and counts how many times each character is used
